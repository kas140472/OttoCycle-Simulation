# Otto Cycle

<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

The main objective of this lab is to demonstrate the change in P-v graph of Otto Cycle and the piston movements of a cylinder working on Otto cycle, as the pressure and volume variables change, as well as calculate and display the heat addition, heat rejection, net work output, and efficiency of the Otto cycle. <br>
