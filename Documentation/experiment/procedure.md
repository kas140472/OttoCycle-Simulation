#### These procedure steps will be followed on the simulator

1. In the simulation window, the Otto cycle graph and the piston are displayed.

4. Move the sliders’ knobs to vary the pressures P1 and P3, the volumes v1 and v3 and gamma. P1 can be varied from 4 to 6 kPa. P3 can be varied from 50 to 60 kPa. V1 can be varied from 15 to 18 m3/kg. V3 can be varied from 5 to 6 m3/kg and gamma can be varied from 1.5 to 1.68.<br>
