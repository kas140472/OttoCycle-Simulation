<center>Experiment: Otto Cycle</center>

**1. Story Outline**:

Otto cycle is a thermodynamics cycle used to describe the working of a spark ignition (petrol) engine. It describes how the chemical energy of gasoline is turned into thermal energy, which is then used to power the motion of a vehicle.

The various processes involved are explained below:

0-1 - Intake phase, which is an isobaric process that takes the air-fuel mixture into the engine chamber, as the piston goes to BDC.

1-2 - This is the isentropic compression phase, where the air-fuel mixture is compressed by the piston as it goes up. At 2, the air-fuel mixture is ready to be ignited by the spark plug.

2-3 - This is the constant volume heat addition, where the air-fuel mixture undergoes combustion. The combustion of the mixture is complete at 3, and is at maximum pressure and high thermal energy.

3-4 - This is the isentropic expansion phase, where the thermal energy performs work on the piston, pushing it down so that the volume increases. This is the power stroke, as this provides motion for the vehicle.

4-1 - This is the constant volume heat rejection phase, where the remaining wasted heat is expelled from the engine chamber. The pressure reduces as the kinetic energy of the gas molecules goes down.

1-0 - The remaining exhaust gases are removed from the chamber through a constant pressure method.

In this experiment, the Otto cycle is demonstrated so that the user can understand how the P-V graph changes as various pressure and volume parameters change.

 **2. Story**:

  **2.1 Set the visual stage description**:

  The experiment consists of the Otto cycle P-V graph. All the buttons and parameters control the right corner of the frame. The variable panel contains sliders for the pressures P1 and P3 and the volumes V1 and V3 and the heat capacity ratio γ.

  The setup consists of a graph that depicts the Otto cycle. A legend at the top indicates the processes involved in each of the curves. There is also a piston cylinder made up of a top-open rectangle and the piston made up of another rectangle that passes through the cylinder.

  By changing the various parameters, the P-V graph changes and the piston moves up and down indicating the various processes in accordance with the change in the graph.

  **2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals**:

  1. Understand the various processes involved in the Otto cycle.
  2. Portray the change in the graph as the parameters are changed.
