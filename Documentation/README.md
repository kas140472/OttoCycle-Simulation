<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

The main objective of this lab is to demonstrate the change in P-v graph of Otto Cycle and the piston movements of a cylinder working on Otto cycle, as the pressure and volume variables change, as well as calculate and display the heat addition, heat rejection, net work output, and efficiency of the Otto cycle. 

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

Otto cycle is a thermodynamics cycle used to describe the working of a spark ignition (petrol) engine. It describes how the chemical energy of gasoline is turned into thermal energy, which is then used to power the motion of a vehicle.
<br><br>
The various processes involved are explained below:<br>
<li>Intake phase, which is an isobaric process that takes the air-fuel mixture into the engine chamber, as the piston goes to BDC.</li>
<li>Isentropic compression phase, where the air-fuel mixture is compressed by the piston as it goes up. At the end of this phase, the air-fuel mixture is ready to be ignited by the spark plug.</li>
<li>Constant volume heat addition, where the air-fuel mixture undergoes combustion. The combustion of the mixture is complete at the end of this phase, and is at maximum pressure and high thermal energy.</li>
<li>Isentropic expansion phase, where the thermal energy performs work on the piston, pushing it down so that the volume increases. This is the power stroke, as this provides motion for the vehicle.</li>
<li>Constant volume heat rejection phase, where the remaining wasted heat is expelled from the engine chamber. The pressure reduces as the kinetic energy of the gas molecules goes down.</li>
<li>Exhaust phase, where the remaining exhaust gases are removed from the chamber through a constant pressure method.</li>
<br>
In this experiment, the Otto cycle is demonstrated so that the user can understand how the P-V graph changes as various pressure and volume parameters change.
